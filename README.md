    A streamlined way to manage collections of voices.

## Why I made this

When I was building my game, I found it annoying to use the ElevenLabs GUI. I could only generate one voice at a time. What I wanted is to be able to have a set of voice messages.

Think of a level up voice in a game. I want to be able to quickly generate 10 of them. The idea behind the variety is so that the user is more engaged. That's why when building my game, I prefer to have a set of voices and randomly pick one message from the set. So when you level up, you won't hear the same voice message over and over again. Causing you to be more engaged and getting more dopamine.

Yes, I know their API exists. But to me, their API makes sense when you need mass generation of voices or on the fly generation.

What I want is to have similar messages quickly generated and be able to download them with a specific naming convention.

If the set's name is "Level Up", files should be named after the order of generation e.g. "level-up-1.mp3", "level-up-2.mp3", etc. This way, when building the game, it's easy to refer to the different voices.
